# React Learning Notes

### Now i will How To Handle DOM and Window Events with React

Step 1 — Extracting Event Data with SyntheticEvent

Step 2 — Adding Multiple Event Handlers to the Same
Element

Step 3 — Adding Window Events

In the next step, you’ll add global event listeners to the Window object to
capture events that occur outside the immediate component.


### How to Build Forms in React

Step 1 — Creating a Basic Form with JSX

Step 2 — Collecting Form Data Using Uncontrolled
Components

Step 3 — Updating Form Data Using Controlled
Components

Step 4 — Dynamically Updating Form Properties

### How to Handle Async Data Loading, Lazy Loading, and Code Spitting with React

Step 1 — Loading Asynchronous Data with useEffect.

In this step, you’ll use the useEffect Hook to load asynchronous data into
a sample application. You’ll use the Hook to prevent unnecessary data
fetching, add placeholders while the data is loading, and update the
component when the data resolves. By the end of this step, you’ll be able to
load data with useEffect and set data using the useState Hook when it
resolves.
To explore the topic, you are going to create an application to display
information about the longest rivers in the world. You’ll load data using an
asynchronous function that simulates a request to an external data source

 Step 2 — Preventing Errors on Unmounted Components

 Step 3 — Lazy Loading a Component with Suspense and lazy

### How To Call Web APIs with the useEffect Hook in React

Step 1 — Creating a Project and a Local API


In this step, you’ll create a local REST API using JSON server, which you
will use as a test data source. Later, you’ll build an application to display a
grocery list and to add items to the list. JSON server will be your local API
and will give you a live URL to make GET and POST requests. With a local
API, you have the opportunity to prototype and test components while you
or another team develops live API

Step 2 — Fetching Data from an API with useEffect

Step 3 — Sending Data to an API

In this step, you’ll send data back to an API using the Fetch API and the POST method. You’ll create a component that will use a web form to send thedata with the onSubmit event handler and will display a success message when the action is complete.

### How To Manage State in React with Redux

In this tutorial, you’ll use Redux in a React application by building a bird watching test application. Users will be able to add birds they have seen and increment a bird each time they see it again. You’ll build a single data store, and you’ll create actions and reducers to update the store. You’ll then pull data into your components and dispatch new changes to update the data.
